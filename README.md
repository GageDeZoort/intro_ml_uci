# Crash Course in Practical Machine Learning
 
We are excited to offer a crash course in practical machine learning (ML), open to the entire School of Physical Sciences community. The goal of this mini-course is to introduce, over the course of three 1.5-hour sessions, several useful methods and concepts in ML, enabling attendees to leverage them in their own research. We welcome any students, researchers, faculty, or staff who may be interested.
 
The course will cover foundational concepts and classical methods in ML, as well as modern deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers. The format will be a mix of brief presentations and extended Jupyter notebook tutorials, with attendees encouraged to run code on their own computers as they follow along. No previous ML knowledge is needed, although to make the most out of the class attendees should be familiar with Python.
 
About the host: Dr. Gage DeZoort is an associate research scholar at Princeton University and a Visiting Fellow of the School of Physical Sciences at UC Irvine. His research focuses on numerical stability and efficient hyperparameter optimization in graph neural networks and graph transformers, and he is keenly interested in applying his models and techniques to scientific data sets. He has also taught several introductory ML mini courses throughout his career.
 
Tentative schedule:
- Day 1 (10/27, 5-6:30 pm at ISEB 1010): Foundational concepts and classical methods in ML
- Day 2 (10/28, 5-6:30 pm at Rowland Hall 160, overflow ISEB 4020): Introduction to deep learning
- Day 3 (10/29, 5-6:30 pm at ISEB 1010): Deep learning architectures like CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers
